I am a [PhD student in physics](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/suren-gourapura) at Princeton University, advised by [Bill Jones](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/william-c-jones). I work on the [SPIDER](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/spider/index.html) and [Taurus](https://www.tauruscmb.com/) experiments, both of which are [balloon-borne](https://www.csbf.nasa.gov/balloons.html) CMB polarimeters. SPIDER measured approximately 10% of the sky from Antarctica, using around 2,000 polarization-sensitive detectors over two flights. Taurus plans to measure about 40% of the sky from mid-latitudes, focusing on excellent cross-linking to measure multipoles with â„“<10.

Summary of work:

* [SPIDER-1 foreground analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20982) with a spectral-domain component separation pipeline

* SPIDER-2 hardware development, including mechanical design, integration, testing, and calibration

* SPIDER-2 low-level analysis, involving the development of data flags and calibration of instrument parameters

* SPIDER-2 pointing simulations, implementation, and reconstruction using CMB intensity fluctuations

Before Princeton, I worked on the [Askaryan Radio Array](https://ara.wipac.wisc.edu/home) and [Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Impulsive_Transient_Antenna) (ARA and ANITA) with Amy Connolly at The Ohio State University, focusing on hardware for ARA and [antenna simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07772) for both projects. Outside of work, I am passionate about [powerlifting](https://sgourapura.github.io/projects/powerlifting/), [woodworking](https://sgourapura.github.io/projects/woodworking/), [coffee](https://sgourapura.github.io/projects/coffee/), and [metal music](https://sgourapura.github.io/projects/music/)!
