I started lifting while training for track and field in highschool. I have lifted ever since, about 14 years. I started powerlifting-style training in earnest my freshman year of undergrad. I followed a 5x5 style program religously and focused on my squat, bench press, and deadlift. Outside of a two push-pull competitions hosted by Ohio State's powerlifting club, I didn't compete until I got to Princeton.

At Princeton, I met Jerry who was the powerlifting president the year before I arrived. We quickly became friends and started training together during Covid. I soon met Isaac, an ex-rower and large individual. Jerry purchased and made some equipment that let us lift in his basement.

Around this time I became the president of the powerlifting club at Princeton. Someone had to hold it together as it went through the covid years. I worked with [Ted Rasmussen](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/tedrasmussen), owner and coact at TNT Strength and Conditioning to have the club still compete in events and train. We moved the basement gym to the garage and purchased a bit more equipment, including a cage and pulley machine.

Jerry, Isaac, and I trained together for more than 3 years at the house, getting very strong and inspiring many of our friends to join us and follow their own fitness journeys. We made shirts, we had our own logo on our powerlifting belts, even the platform had a logo.

I competed in [three meets](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/surengourapura) and am proud of what I accomplished. My best competition lifts are:
* Squat: 413.3 lbs
* Bench: 343.5 lbs
* Deadlift: 551.1 lbs
* Best Total (achieved in one meet, not across meets): 1184.9 lbs
* I competed between 173-183 lbs bodyweight

Since then, I have done some olympic lifting. My best snatch is 135 lbs, best clean is 225, and best clean and jerk is 215 lbs.

I have also road biked and rock climbed on and off during grad school. I am currently taking running more seriously and trying to be a well-rounded, healthy individual moving forwards.
