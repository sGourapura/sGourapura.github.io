Coffee is easy to obsess over. I think this is because of three things:
* There is a huge difference between bad and good coffee
* There are many variable to making good coffee
* There are many fun gadgets that make the process enjoyable

# Espresso setup

##### Espresso Machine: Profitec Go
* Temperature and Pressure adjustment
* Built-in shot timer, temperature readout, and pressure gauge
* Slow to warm up for some reason. Steam tip was 1 hole, which we upgraded to 4
* Fantastic overall

##### Main Grinder: Eureka Mignon Silenzio
* Extremely heavy and quite quiet
* Clogs every few months but pretty easy to take apart
* Grind adjustment is sensitive but doesn't keep track of complete rotations, which makes it hard for pourover and espresso use at the same time

##### Second Grinder: Baratza Encore
* Being used as a decaf grinder
* A bit hard to fine tune and loud, but no clogging

##### Coffee for Espresso
* Orinoco Ethiopian
* Groundwork Ethiopian
* Wegmans Ethiopian (Used to be excellent but something changed in ~2024)

##### Accessories
* Microfiber cloth
* Needle distribution tool
* Metal funnel
* ACME cups. They are so nice to use!

# Pourover setup

##### Hario V60 cone and paper
* No complaints, light and portable

##### Hario V60 insulated carafe
* Incredible carafe, well made and robust
* A bit hard to clean

##### Grinder: 1Zpresso X-Pro S
* Wood handle, aluminum construction, no complaints
* Threaded catch cup is wonderful. They moved to magnetic catch cups now; I own one and it falls off and spills ground coffee on the ground all the time

##### Wood Stand
* Homemade with ash
* stained with espresso so it is already as stained as it will ever be!

##### Kettle: Fellow Stagg EKG
* Wonderful to use, intuitive and well built
* Wish it had a fast pour spout as well as the gooseneck, for making tea

##### Coffee for pourover
* Elevator coffee subscription 
* We met these folks when they were in St. George and they blew us away with a cool extra fermented coffee
